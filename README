Breaking Down onLoad
====================

This script has a form of bookmarklet and uses [Navigation Timing object](https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/webperf/raw-file/tip/specs/NavigationTiming/Overview.html) to present timing of different phases of loading the web page. 

It is a visual presentation of the content of `performance.timing`  object.

Adding it to your bookmarks allows you to analyze performance of every request you'd like to check out.

So far Navigation Timing API works in Firefox 7+, Chrome and IE 9+
